# Bitter Build Utility

Bitter experience has taught me how difficult it is to create a productive and
scriptable work flow with Xilinx tools. This utility is an attempt to make it
easier to quickly get a Xilinx project setup and building.

## Perquisites

The following Python packages and programs need to be installed for bitter to work.

### Python packages

Besides the default python install the following package need to be installed.

```bash
python3 -m pip install click
```

### Xilinx tools

Instructions on how to install Xilinx in a docker volume are detailed within a
README in the docker directory.
